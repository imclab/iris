* Motivation
  We'd like to make a [[http://developer.factual.com/display/docs/Factual+Developer+APIs+Version+3][Factually-aware]] Siri-clone using Google's
  clandestine [[http://mikepultz.com/2011/03/accessing-google-speech-api-chrome-11/][speech-to-text]] (and [[http://techcrunch.com/2009/12/14/the-unofficial-google-text-to-speech-api/][text-to-speech]]) APIs; to that end,
  we implemented the trivial grammar "find $x$ in $y$" and "find $x$
  near me."

  Commands are spoken and results are read back.

* Usage
  Iris is on [[http://clojars.org/iris][Clojars]]; add the following to your =:dependencies=:
  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    [iris "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"]
  #+END_SRC
  and use with:
  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (:use iris.core)
  #+END_SRC

* API
  Iris has three main functions: =listen=, =consider=, =answer= which
  depend upon the dynamic variables: =*factual-key*= and
  =*factual-secret*=; Iris can be invoked followingly:
  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
    (binding [*factual-key* factual-key
              *factual-secret* factual-secret]
      (answer (consider (listen))))
  #+END_SRC

* TODO
  It would be nice to implement a real natural-language interface to
  Factual's data; and integrate it with our demo.
